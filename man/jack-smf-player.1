.TH "JACK-SMF-PLAYER" "1" "03 May 2008" "jack-smf-player 1.0" ""

.SH NAME
jack-smf-player \- Standard MIDI File player for JACK MIDI
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBjack-smf-player\fR [ \fB-a \fIinput port\fB\fR ] [ \fB-d\fR ] [ \fB-n\fR ] [ \fB-q\fR ] [ \fB-s\fR ] [ \fB-t\fR ] [ \fB-V\fR ] [ \fB-r \fIrate\fB\fR ] [ \fBfile name\fR ]

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-a \fIinput port\fB\fR
Automatically connect to the named input port.  Note that this may cause problems with LASH.
.TP
\fB-d\fR
When throttling, drop messages instead of delaying them.
.TP
\fB-n\fR
Don't start JACK transport at startup.
.TP
\fB-q\fR
Be quiet, don't print messages about SMF metaevents etc.
.TP
\fB-s\fR
By default, \fBjack-smf-player\fR creates one output port, "midi_out",
through which MIDI messages from all tracks are sent with their original MIDI channel
number unchanged, and then one port per track, through which only MIDI messages from
that particular track are sent with their MIDI channel reset to 0.  That may cause
problems with large number of tracks, as the number of JACK ports is a limited resource.
Passing the "-s" option causes \fBjack-smf-player\fR to not create
per-channel output ports.  This option does not change behaviour of the "midi_out" port.
.TP
\fB-t\fR
Do not use JACK transport.  That means that playback will not start when the transport
starts, will not seek when transport is relocated etc.  Also, this flag will make
\fBjack-smf-player\fR exit after the end of the song.
.TP
\fB-V\fR
Print version number to standard output and exit.
.TP
\fB-r \fIrate\fB\fR
Set output rate limit to \fIrate\fR, in Kbaud.  Limit
defined by the MIDI specification is 31.25.  By default this parameter is zero, that
is, rate limiting is disabled.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBjack-smf-player\fR is a tool to play SMF (Standard MIDI Format) files
through JACK MIDI.  At startup, it will load file which name is passed as a parameter,
and, unless the "-n" option is given, rewind JACK transport to position zero and start
playing.  You can pause, play and seek using JACK transport, for example by using buttons
under the display in qjackctl.
